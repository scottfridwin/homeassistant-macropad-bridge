# Security policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives fixes. Images are rebuilt automatically when the base image or dependencies get security updates.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/scottfridwin/homeassistant-macropad-bridge/security/advisories/new) rather than in a public issue. Include the image version, how to reproduce the problem and its impact. You should get a response within a week.

## Verifying images

Every published image has a build provenance attestation signed by GitHub Actions:

```bash
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/scottfridwin/homeassistant-macropad-bridge:1 --repo scottfridwin/homeassistant-macropad-bridge
```
